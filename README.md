I have created this (HTML language only) website for the First Project Assignment "Odin-Recipes" on The Odin Project Website.

I used what I studied in the previous lessons from paragraphs, strong texts, headings, lists, images and links.

I didn't use some things like emphasised texts, which I didn't feel was necessary in my website.

And, that's about it.
